Mood and behaviour tracker web application using localStorage.

## Concept

The idea is a customizable mood tracker that allows entering every miniscule detail in life to draw conclusions about how particular actions influence your mood and fitness. It should be customizable because not everyone may be comfortable tracking absolutely everything, or some things just don't apply to a particular lifestyle.

Entirely based on localStorage (in a later step possibly with optional syncing) because I really don't need to know what ails users, and because nobody besides them should know.

If legally within reach and if the user so desires, the app should offer recommendations, for example: "Eating within two hours before going to bed usually makes you groggy the next morning," to make the user a tiny bit smarter. Even if it's not possible soon, it's still gonna be helpful for the user to have a platform to make those conclusions themselves. It's harder but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Design Drafts

The concept needs to be defined more closely, but the following drafts may present a rough idea of what this could look like and to further understand the concept.
